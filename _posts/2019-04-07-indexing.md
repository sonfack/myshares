Hi every one !  
This post is about Indexing and we will in the first part concentrate on indexing textual information.  
#### Document 
![Document](/indexing/document.png){:height="20%"}
From Wikepedia, a document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of thought.  
Another definition if from the **ISO-TC 46**, which defined a document as a combination of an information content and a
supporting physical carrier.  
Indexing is the process of storing an intity in such that is will be easy to retreive or search for some part of it.  

*Document = information + support carrier*

**Information media source**:
* sound 
* still image 
* text 
* sequences of images ( video )

**Support carriers** :
* Paper 
* digital
* web 
* magnetics 

#### In this paper will focus on text 
Indexing text, is translating the text into a language specefic design. This can be done in 03 steps:  
1 **Identifying the index terms**  
2 **Choosing the weights to assign to the indexed terms** base on the importance given to a term  
3 **Structure the indexes**
    We have techniques like:  
    * Inverted files   
    * Hashing tables   
    * Tree structures   
    * etc   
  
### Index terms: Identifying index terms  
Index terms are elements that describe the content of the text and it structure(chapter, section, ...)  
Two major languages are use to do this task :  
1 **Controlled language**  
It is a predefined language also call *thesaurus* and is used to manually annotate text  
2 **Uncontrolled language**  
In this case, there is no predefined language, index terms are generally chosen according to the contents of the text 
to index. The text may be automatically annotated.  
  
### Chosen weight for index terms  
Most used techniques are automatic ones based on count or frequencies (TF : term frequency and IDF: inverse document 
frequency), or on vector transformation of text(Word2vec, Glove).  
The main difference between the count and the vector transformation is that the count method transforms elements of the 
the text independently  while the vector transformation will keep the relationship between element(word ou sentence for 
for example).   
Others may be independent of the document and a function of the element types.  
### Structuring indexes  
Final task of indexing, make use of :  
* inverted files  
* Hashing tables  
* Tree structures
